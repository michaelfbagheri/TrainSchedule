# TrainSchedule

https://michaelfbagheri.github.io/TrainSchedule/

This app utlizes Moment and Firebase to create a train station schedule which you can add runs to.  you provide details regarding what time the first train of the day arrives at this station, along with frequency (every how often trains pass through), and the app will add it to the board and tell you when to expect the next train.
